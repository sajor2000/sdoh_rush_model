# Model Calibration Solutions for SDOH Prediction Model

## Problem Identified
The calibration curve shows that the model's predicted probabilities don't match the actual observed frequencies well. This is a common issue with tree-based models like XGBoost.

## Why Calibration Matters
- **Clinical Decision Making**: Doctors need accurate risk probabilities, not just rankings
- **Resource Allocation**: Proper calibration ensures we screen the right proportion of patients
- **Trust**: Well-calibrated probabilities are more interpretable and trustworthy

## Solutions to Fix Calibration

### 1. **Platt Scaling** (Recommended for your use case)
Platt scaling fits a sigmoid function to transform the raw predictions into calibrated probabilities.

**Pros:**
- Simple and fast
- Works well when you have limited calibration data
- Preserves the ranking of predictions
- Good for binary classification

**Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Using your existing model
calibrated_model = CalibratedClassifierCV(
    base_estimator=your_xgboost_model,
    method='sigmoid',  # Platt scaling
    cv=3  # Use cross-validation
)
calibrated_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 2. **Isotonic Regression**
A non-parametric method that finds a monotonic transformation of the predictions.

**Pros:**
- More flexible than Platt scaling
- Can handle non-linear calibration errors
- No assumptions about the functional form

**Cons:**
- Can overfit with small datasets
- May not generalize as well

**Implementation:**
```python
calibrated_model = CalibratedClassifierCV(
    base_estimator=your_xgboost_model,
    method='isotonic',
    cv=3
)
```

### 3. **Temperature Scaling** (Simple but effective)
Multiply the logits by a temperature parameter T before applying sigmoid.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Find optimal temperature using validation set
def temperature_scale(logits, temperature):
    return logits / temperature

# Optimize temperature to minimize ECE or log loss
```

### 4. **Beta Calibration**
A more sophisticated method that uses beta distributions.

**When to use:**
- When you have enough data
- When Platt scaling isn't sufficient
- For more complex calibration curves

## Recommended Approach for Your Model

Given your model's characteristics:
- Binary classification (2+ SDOH needs)
- XGBoost model with max_depth=3
- Clinical deployment context

**I recommend Platt Scaling because:**
1. It's robust and well-tested in medical applications
2. Your model is already simplified (shallow trees)
3. It maintains interpretability
4. Fast inference time for production

## Implementation Steps

1. **Split your data** into train/calibration/test sets (60/20/20)
2. **Train XGBoost** on the training set
3. **Calibrate** using the calibration set
4. **Evaluate** on the test set

## Expected Improvements

After calibration, you should see:
- **ECE (Expected Calibration Error)** reduced from ~0.15 to <0.05
- **Calibration curve** closer to the diagonal line
- **Brier score** improvement
- **Maintained discrimination** (AUC stays the same)

## Quick Fix for Production

If you need a quick fix without retraining:

```python
# Simple temperature scaling
def quick_calibrate(raw_probs, temp=1.2):
    """Apply temperature scaling to raw probabilities"""
    # Convert to logits
    epsilon = 1e-7
    logits = np.log(raw_probs / (1 - raw_probs + epsilon))
    
    # Scale and convert back
    scaled_logits = logits / temp
    calibrated_probs = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-scaled_logits))
    
    return calibrated_probs
```

## Monitoring Calibration

After deployment, monitor:
- **ECE** monthly
- **Reliability diagrams** quarterly  
- **Brier score** trends
- **Calibration by subgroups** (age, race, etc.)

## Visual Check

A well-calibrated model should show:
- Calibration curve close to diagonal
- Histogram showing good distribution of predictions
- Low ECE (<0.05 for clinical use)

## Next Steps

1. Implement Platt scaling on your model
2. Generate new calibration plots
3. Update the executive summary with improved calibration
4. Document the calibration method used
5. Set up monitoring for calibration drift

This will significantly improve the clinical utility of your model while maintaining its excellent discrimination and fairness properties.
