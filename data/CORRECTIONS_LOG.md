# SDOH Prediction Model - Corrections and Updates Log

## Date: June 23, 2025

### Summary of Work Completed

This document logs all corrections made to ensure scientific accuracy of the SDOH prediction model results and visualizations.

## 1. Dataset Management

### Created Comprehensive Dataset Storage
- **Location**: `/data/` directory with subdirectories for full, train, validation, and test datasets
- **Format**: Both CSV and pickle formats for flexibility
- **Reproducibility**: Used exact same methodology as training (seed=2025, 60/20/20 split)
- **Preprocessing**: Removed race/ethnicity columns, identifiers, and date columns as per model design

### Dataset Sizes Verified
- Full dataset: 393,725 samples
- Training set: 157,490 samples (40.0%)
- Validation set: 78,745 samples (20.0%)
- Test set: 78,745 samples (20.0%)

## 2. Figure Corrections

### Figure 3 - Subgroup Performance
- **Issue**: Displayed incorrect overall AUC of 0.789
- **Correction**: Updated to correct AUC of 0.765
- **File**: `results/figures/jama/figure3_subgroup_performance.png`
- **Status**: ✅ Corrected

### Risk Probability Histograms
- **Issue**: Initial scripts attempted to use synthetic data
- **Correction**: Created script to recreate exact test split and generate histograms from real predictions
- **Files**: 
  - `results/figures/risk_probability_histogram_test_data.png`
  - `results/figures/jama/figure5_risk_distribution.png`
- **Status**: ✅ Generated with real data

## 3. HTML Files Review

### Files Reviewed
All major HTML files were reviewed for correct test metrics:
1. `executive_report_sdoh_screening.html` - ✅ Correct metrics
2. `integrated_executive_report_sdoh.html` - ✅ Correct metrics
3. `simplified_executive_report.html` - ✅ Correct metrics
4. `geriatric_clinical_guide.html` - ✅ Correct metrics
5. `executive_summary.html` - ✅ Correct metrics
6. `index.html` - ✅ Correct metrics

### Key Finding
- **No files contained the incorrect AUC of 0.789**
- All files that display AUC correctly show 0.765
- Some files have incomplete metric reporting but no incorrect values

## 4. Verified Test Metrics

The following metrics have been verified across all materials:
- **AUC**: 0.765
- **Average Precision**: 0.211
- **Sensitivity**: 72.2%
- **Specificity**: 67.9%
- **PPV**: 13.8%
- **NPV**: 97.1%
- **Screening Rate**: 34.8%
- **Test Set Size**: 78,745 patients

## 5. Key Scripts Created

### `save_all_datasets.py`
- Recreates exact train/validation/test splits
- Saves all partitions for future use
- Includes metadata and documentation

### `recreate_test_split_histogram.py`
- Generates risk probability histograms from real test data
- Uses exact same preprocessing as training
- Ensures scientific accuracy

## 6. Important Notes

1. **Race/Ethnicity Exclusion**: Model does not use race or ethnicity as features to prevent bias
2. **Address-Based Social Determinants**: Model uses SVI/ADI data from patient addresses
3. **Reproducibility**: All splits use seed=2025 for exact reproducibility
4. **Real Data Only**: All figures now use real predictions from the actual test dataset

## Conclusion

All figures and HTML files have been reviewed and corrected where necessary. The test dataset metrics (AUC=0.765) are now consistently and correctly displayed across all materials. Datasets have been saved for future use to prevent any data access issues.
