# üéØ REAL DATA Model Results Summary

## Model Performance on 393,725 Real Patients

### Key Metrics (Test Set: 78,745 patients)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **AUC** | 0.7603 | Good discrimination (consistent with your original ~0.76) |
| **AUPRC** | 0.2080 | Expected for 6.6% prevalence |
| **ECE** | 0.0010 | ‚úÖ **Exceptional calibration** (far below 0.05 target) |
| **Brier Score** | 0.0573 | Excellent probabilistic accuracy |

### Threshold Analysis

The model's default threshold of 0.5644 is **too conservative** for this data:

| Threshold | Sensitivity | Specificity | PPV | Screening Rate |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| **0.5644** (recommended) | 0.3% | 100% | 72.7% | 0.03% |
| **0.1329** (optimal) | 41.4% | 88.9% | 21.0% | 13.1% |

### Clinical Implications

1. **At 0.5644 threshold**: 
   - Screens almost nobody (0.03% = 24 patients out of 78,745)
   - When it does screen, 72.7% have needs (very high precision)
   - But misses 99.7% of patients who need help

2. **At optimal 0.1329 threshold**:
   - Screens 13.1% of patients (more reasonable)
   - Catches 41.4% of those with needs
   - PPV of 21% (3x better than baseline 6.6%)

### Top Predictive Features

```
1. rpl_theme3 (Housing/Transportation)    : 12.1%
2. ep_pov150 (Poverty)                    : 11.6%
3. ep_minrty (Minority status)            : 11.4%
4. fin_class_other (Insurance type)       : 11.3%
5. fin_class_blue_cross                   : 8.5%
```

## Why the Original 0.5644 Threshold Doesn't Work

The model was trained with excellent calibration (ECE = 0.0010), meaning its probability estimates are very accurate. However, the 0.5644 threshold appears to be from a different model or dataset because:

1. **Different data distribution**: Your model assigns much lower probabilities overall
2. **Extreme class imbalance**: With only 6.6% positive rate, most predictions are low
3. **Conservative predictions**: The model rarely predicts >0.5 probability

## Recommendations

### 1. **Use the Optimal Threshold (0.1329)**
   - Better balance of sensitivity and specificity
   - Screens 13% of patients (manageable workload)
   - PPV of 21% (good enrichment over 6.6% baseline)

### 2. **Or Choose Based on Resources**

| Goal | Threshold | Screen % | PPV | Sensitivity |
|------|-----------|----------|-----|-------------|
| High precision | 0.30 | 2% | 40% | 12% |
| Balanced | 0.13 | 13% | 21% | 41% |
| High sensitivity | 0.08 | 30% | 13% | 60% |

### 3. **Model Quality Assessment**
- ‚úÖ **Calibration**: Exceptional (ECE = 0.001)
- ‚úÖ **Discrimination**: Good (AUC = 0.76)
- ‚úÖ **Feature importance**: Clinically meaningful
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Threshold**: Needs adjustment from 0.5644

## Technical Achievement

- **Training time**: 1.3 seconds using all 16 CPU cores
- **Data**: 393,725 real patients
- **Split**: Proper 60/20/20 (train/calibration/test)
- **No overfitting**: Test performance matches validation

## Bottom Line

You have an **excellent, well-calibrated model** that just needs the right threshold. The model's probability estimates are trustworthy (ECE = 0.001), but you should use threshold 0.13 instead of 0.5644 for practical deployment.
