# ðŸ”¬ Scientifically Valid SDOH Model - Executive Summary

## Methodology Validation

### Proper Data Split Usage (No Data Leakage)
- **Training Set (60%, n=236,235)**: Used exclusively for model fitting
- **Validation Set (20%, n=78,745)**: Used for:
  - Model calibration (Platt scaling)
  - Optimal threshold selection
  - Early stopping during training
- **Test Set (20%, n=78,745)**: Held out completely until final evaluation
  - Never used for any model decisions
  - Provides unbiased performance estimates

### Key Methodological Safeguards
1. âœ… Threshold selected on validation set only (0.0500)
2. âœ… Test set never influenced any modeling decisions
3. âœ… All reported metrics below are from the held-out test set
4. âœ… Calibration performed on validation set, not test set

## Unbiased Test Set Performance

### Overall Model Performance
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **AUC** | 0.7650 | Good discrimination ability |
| **AUPRC** | 0.2110 | 3.2x better than baseline (0.066) |
| **ECE** | 0.0075 âœ… | Excellent calibration (target <0.05) |
| **Brier Score** | 0.0583 | Low prediction error |

### Performance at Validation-Selected Threshold (0.0500)
| Metric | Value | Clinical Impact |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Screening Rate** | 34.8% | Manageable workload |
| **Sensitivity** | 72.2% | Captures 7 out of 10 patients with needs |
| **Specificity** | 67.9% | Correctly excludes 2/3 of low-risk patients |
| **PPV** | 13.8% | 2.1x improvement over baseline (6.6%) |
| **NPV** | 97.2% | High confidence in negative predictions |

### Overfitting Assessment
- Validation AUC: 0.7759
- Test AUC: 0.7650
- **Difference: 0.0109** âœ… (No significant overfitting)

## Model Characteristics

### Training Approach
- **Base Model**: XGBoost with balanced parameters
- **Calibration**: Platt scaling (sigmoid calibration)
- **Parameters**: Optimized to avoid overly conservative predictions
  - max_depth: 5
  - scale_pos_weight: 0.8
  - n_estimators: 200

### Key Features (Top 5)
1. Housing/Transportation vulnerability (rpl_theme3)
2. Insurance type indicators
3. Socioeconomic status metrics
4. Healthcare utilization patterns
5. Geographic vulnerability indices

## Clinical Deployment Recommendations

### Immediate Implementation
1. **Use threshold = 0.0500** (scientifically validated)
2. **Expected outcomes per 10,000 patients**:
   - Screen: 3,480 patients
   - Identify: ~480 patients with SDOH needs
   - Miss: ~180 patients with needs (28% false negative rate)

### Monitoring Requirements
1. **Monthly metrics**:
   - Screening rate (target: 30-40%)
   - PPV (should remain >12%)
   - ECE (must stay <0.05)

2. **Quarterly recalibration** if:
   - ECE exceeds 0.05
   - Screening rate falls outside 25-45%
   - PPV drops below 12%

### Resource Adjustment Options
| Resources | Threshold | Screening Rate | Sensitivity | PPV |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| Limited | 0.08 | ~20% | ~55% | ~18% |
| Standard | 0.05 | ~35% | ~72% | ~14% |
| Expanded | 0.04 | ~42% | ~78% | ~12% |

## Executive Summary

This SDOH screening model was developed using scientifically rigorous methodology with proper train/validation/test splits and no data leakage. The model achieves:

1. **Strong performance**: AUC of 0.765 with excellent calibration (ECE = 0.0075)
2. **Clinical utility**: Screens 35% of patients while maintaining 2x better PPV than random screening
3. **Balanced approach**: 72% sensitivity ensures most at-risk patients are identified
4. **Deployment ready**: All metrics are from held-out test data, providing realistic performance expectations

The model is ready for clinical deployment with clear thresholds, monitoring guidelines, and proven performance on unseen data.
