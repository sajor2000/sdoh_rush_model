================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Senior patients (65+) have different SDOH risk profiles compared to the general
population. This analysis provides evidence-based threshold recommendations
specifically optimized for senior clinics.

Key Findings:
• SDOH prevalence in seniors: 4.7%
• Recommended threshold: 0.084
• Expected screening rate: 7.7%
• Expected PPV: 19.5%
• Sensitivity: 31.8%

SENIOR POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
----------------------------------------
Total senior patients analyzed: 98,551
Age distribution:
  • 65-74: 52,919 (53.7%) - SDOH prevalence: 5.7%
  • 75-84: 33,663 (34.2%) - SDOH prevalence: 3.6%
  • 85+: 11,969 (12.1%) - SDOH prevalence: 3.3%


THRESHOLD RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================

1. BALANCED APPROACH (Recommended)
------------------------------
Threshold: 0.0842
Performance Metrics:
  • Screening rate: 7.7%
  • Sensitivity: 31.8%
  • Specificity: 93.5%
  • PPV: 19.5%
  • NPV: 96.5%
  • Number needed to screen: 5.1
Resource Impact (per 1,000 seniors):
  • Patients screened: 76
  • True positives found: 20
  • False positives: 61

2. RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED SETTING
------------------------------
Threshold: 0.5000
Performance Metrics:
  • Screening rate: 0.2%
  • Sensitivity: 1.5%
  • PPV: 44.9%
  • Number needed to screen: 2.2

3. HIGH SENSITIVITY APPROACH
------------------------------
Threshold: 0.0100
Performance Metrics:
  • Screening rate: 100.0%
  • Sensitivity: 100.0%
  • PPV: 4.7%
  • Number needed to screen: 21.2


IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
========================================

1. Senior-Specific Factors:
   • Higher baseline SDOH prevalence
   • Multiple chronic conditions common
   • Fixed income considerations
   • Transportation barriers more prevalent
   • Social isolation risks

2. Workflow Integration:
   • Align with Medicare Annual Wellness Visit
   • Coordinate with geriatric assessments
   • Consider cognitive screening timing
   • Integrate with care transitions

3. Resource Requirements:
   • Estimated 8% of appointments need screening
   • Average screening time: 15-20 minutes
   • Social worker consultations for 19% of screened
   • Community resource connections needed

QUALITY METRICS TO MONITOR
----------------------------------------
1. Process Measures:
   • Screening completion rate
   • Time to intervention after positive screen
   • Referral completion rates

2. Outcome Measures:
   • Reduction in ED visits
   • Improvement in medication adherence
   • Patient satisfaction scores
   • Caregiver burden assessment

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================
1. Implement threshold of 0.084 for senior clinics
2. Train staff on senior-specific SDOH issues
3. Establish partnerships with Area Agencies on Aging
4. Monitor performance monthly for first 6 months
5. Adjust threshold based on resource availability
6. Consider pilot in one clinic before full rollout
